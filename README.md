# A-little-automation
I'm creating this repository for my automation projects. 

The purpose of these basic automation scripts is to show how lazy becoming a programmer makes you and how far we can go to not repeat manual and boring tasks daily.
I encourage comments or ideas on how to improve my scripts given that I'm learning the basics for now and hope to better skills in the near future. 
For example, I know that this script has a flaw, that it doesn't give the user the option of closing the browser himself form the main browser. This could be done with the "detach" experimental option but it's not working for me, so I had to find a way around it. I will also upload the code for that version of the script where the line *options.add_experimental_option('detach', True)* isnÂ´t working for me.

DISCLAIMER:
I am aware of how basic this script is and am not ashamed of it in the least.
